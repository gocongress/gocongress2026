## New To GitHub? Here Is a Guide on How to Use This Repo

### 1. Check Existing Issues

Go to the **[Issues](https://github.com/gocongress/gocongress2026/issues)** tab to see ongoing discussions. Each issue represents a topic or task.

### 2. Comment in an Issue

If you have input on an existing topic, open the issue and add your comment. This keeps conversation organized instead of spreading across emails or chats.

### 3. [Create a New Issue](https://github.com/gocongress/gocongress2026/issues/new/choose)

[Create a new issue](https://github.com/gocongress/gocongress2026/issues/new/choose) when:

* You want to propose a new idea
* You need clarification on a topic
* You want to document a meeting outcome or task

Give it a clear title, a short description of what should be discussed, and fitting label(s). Labels help categorize issues. If you are unsure which label(s) to pick, leave it unlabeled and someone will help.

Shared documents or summaries referenced in issues can be linked directly in the issue thread. Use cloud links (for example, public Google Doc links) rather than uploading personal files.
